The repo only contains a single file for the whole source code, it was requested by a friend of mine and I decided to work it for the said friend.

The way it works is by using these commands,
"php show_api.php state=<insert your state selection here>"
or
"php show_api.php area=<insert your area selection here>"

and the program will outputs the recent data based on the time that you are in. If in the event that the page is not loaded, it could be the problem that the side time-update is not up-to-date with the program's clock. Just try it again sometimes.
